                                 NIS::DBM 0.02
                                 -------------

NIS::DBM presents the dbm files used by NIS as a single hash indexed by
username and uid (when in doubt, it's a username).  The indexing behavior 
may be changed at any time after the tied hash is created.  The tie 
supports all normal hash operations except clearing the hash (we don't 
want to easily get rid of the entire database).  The code tries to minimize 
the file operations needed to correctly present the information and modify 
the dbm files.

While the code will try to detect the use of adjunct files, this is not
perfect.  In addition, only one kind of adjunct file usage is supported.
If there are other types, please send the details to <jgsmith@tamu.edu>.

NIS::DBM requires the following modules from CPAN:
     IniConf
     Net::NIS

NIS::DBM relies on the correct implementation of the following
modules in the standard Perl distribution:
     Carp
     NDBM_File
     Fcntl
     IPC::Open3
     LockFile::Simple

To install, simply type

     $ perl Makefile.PL
     $ make
     $ make install

See the example configuration file in sample/accounts.conf.  This should 
be copied to a suitable place and the daemons and other code be made aware 
of it.  A sample yppasswd daemon is provided in sample/ also along with 
the Makefile for the C code to tie the Perl functions to the RPC interface.  
This uses the Sun/Solaris RPC definition (.x) file (or at least an 
approximation of it).

------------------------
N.B. concerning IniConf:
------------------------

IniConf has a few peculiarities.  However, IniConf easily gives me the 
capabilities I want.  As IniConf is distributed, do not put any spaces
between the brackets and the section names in the configuration file.
Also, ensure that all the sections required actually exist.  This can
cause a fatal error if they do not.  Patching IniConf to work well is
not too difficult.  I have sent the included patch to the IniConf author.
The patch should work with version 0.92 of IniConf.
