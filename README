                                 -------------

NIS::DBM presents the dbm files used by NIS as a single hash indexed by
username and uid (when in doubt, it's a username).  The tie supports all
normal hash operations except clearing the hash (we don't want to easily
get rid of the entire database).  The code tries to minimize the file
operations needed to correctly present the information and modify the
dbm files.

To install, simply type

     $ perl Makefile.PL
     $ make
     $ make install

See the example configuration file in sample/accounts.conf.  This should be
copied to a suitable place and the daemons and other code be made aware of it.
A sample yppasswd daemon is provided in sample/ also along with the Makefile
for the C code to tie the Perl functions to the RPC interface.  This uses the
Sun/Solaris RPC definition (.x) file (or at least an approximation of it).
